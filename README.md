### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page!

Currently I am working as a software developer engineer at Fred Hutchinson as a part of the [Hutch Data Core](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/shared-resources/core-facilities/hutch-data-core.html). My team works to bring computational resources and solutions to the biologists that work at Fred Hutch!

I'm active on GitHub so feel free to reach out here or through my Twitter (@wolfnado).
