### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page!

Currently I am working as a software developer engineer at Fred Hutchinson as a part of the [Hutch Data Core](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/shared-resources/core-facilities/hutch-data-core.html). My team works to bring computational resources and solutions to the biologists that work at Fred Hutch!

### A little bit about me:

🤠 Throughout my career I've worn many different hats

🧑‍🔬 I graduated college in 2014 with a degree in molecular biology and immdediately started working as a lab technician. I found that lab work itself isn't what drives me (taking pH's all day just wasn't doing it).

💻 After many discussions with my younger sister, who was getting her degree in CS at the time, I decided to go back to school! I completed the [University of Oregon's Bioinformatics and Genomics Graduate Internship Program](https://internship.uoregon.edu/bioinformatics) in 2016.

🧬 I completed my internship and took a job in Paul Kulesa's laboratory at The Stower's Institute in Kansas City, Missouri. Here, I analyzed bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data and prepared figures for manuscripts.

🛫 After about two years in Kansas City, it was time to come home. I moved back to Seattle in July 2017.

🌧️ I joined Raphael Gottardo's lab in August of 2017 as a Software Developer Engineer. I spent two years here working on the ImmuneSpace platform and related R packages.

📁 In June of 2019 I moved on to a role with the Hutch Data Commonwealth. I worked as a product manager working to develop a data sharing platform that would host data on available biospecimens at Fred Hutchinson, University of British Columbia, and Oregon Health and Science University. I interfaced between the development team, internal and external stakeholders, and researchers providing data to make sure everyone was on the same page.

🧑‍🏫 With the onset of COVID-19, Fred Hutch went through a reorganization and I was moved to training. For about a year and a half I worked on projects building out coursework and teaching classes developed specifically to teach biologists core coding concepts.

🛠️ Due to staffing changes I was moved to the Hutch Data Core development team. Which is where I am today.
