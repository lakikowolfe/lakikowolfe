### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page!

Currently I am working as a software developer engineer at Fred Hutchinson as a part of the [Hutch Data Core](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/shared-resources/core-facilities/hutch-data-core.html). My team works to bring computational resources and solutions to the biologists that work at Fred Hutch!

*I'm active on GitHub so feel free to reach out here or through my Twitter (@wolfnado).*
